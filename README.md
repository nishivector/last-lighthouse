# Last Lighthouse

The fog is thick. The beam is fading. You are the last lighthouse keeper.

A tense action game where you must save ships from crashing into rocks by rotating your failing lighthouse beam. Ships drift through the foggy darkness—hold your warm amber light on them to guide them to safety.

## How to Play

- **Drag left/right** to rotate the lighthouse beam
- **Hold the beam on ships** to rescue them (watch them glow amber as they're saved)
- **Avoid rocks** scattered around the sea—ships that hit rocks are lost
- Save as many ships as you can before losing 5 ships to crashes or the open sea
